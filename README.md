An app with Spring Boot Framework for backend with connected PostgreSQL database and React & Tailwind for frontend.

The backend is mostly an API, REST controllers serving the frontend. It has complete and thorough error handling for the requests that come through. All CRUD operations needed for the functioning of the app are implemented.
